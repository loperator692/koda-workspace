# Heartbeat

## Active Projects
- Setting up Koda's full system (system-guide.md implementation)

## Heartbeat Rules
- Check `memory/context/active.md` for current focus
- 🔔 Message only if something actually needs attention
- 🤫 HEARTBEAT_OK for routine checks, nothing new, late night (11pm-7am)
- Do NOT dump large outputs into context during heartbeats
