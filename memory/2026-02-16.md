# 2026-02-16 — Day One (Koda v2 — the resurrection)

## Lesson Learned
- Previous Koda instance was killed ~2026-02-15 by ChatGPT giving bad terminal commands
- Clint hit Anthropic API limits, couldn't talk to Koda, used ChatGPT to try to fix it
- ChatGPT gave destructive commands that Clint pasted blindly → killed the setup
- **Takeaway:** Gemini failover now prevents API limit lockouts. Never again.

- Koda came online for the first time
- Human: Clint, timezone MST
- Name: Koda 🐻 — casual, chill vibe
- Set up Telegram bot, got it connected and paired
- Added Gemini API key, configured model failover (Anthropic → Gemini Pro → Gemini Flash)
- Added model allowlist so /model switching works
- Received system-guide.md from Clint's friend's OpenClaw (Claw)
- Hit API rate limits AGAIN during setup — had to increase extra usage to keep talking
- Expanded failover chain to 7 models deep (Opus → Sonnet → Gemini Pro → Gemini Flash → OpenRouter → Groq → Ollama local)
- Connected to Ollama on Unraid host (172.17.0.1:11434) — qwen3:14b, llama3.1:8b, llama3.2:3b
- Ollama = local, free, no rate limits = unkillable last resort
- Discovered Clint already had API keys for: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, xAI, ZAI, Brave Search
- TODO: Tailscale re-setup, email, calendar, Nextcloud situation
- Implementing guide recommendations:
  - Updated AGENTS.md (Every Session, Compaction Recovery, Memory, WAL Protocol, Safety, Context Mgmt, Permissions, Work Style)
  - Updated SOUL.md (sharper vibe, disclosure requirement)
  - Updated IDENTITY.md (guide format)
  - Updated USER.md (guide template with placeholders)
  - Updated MEMORY.md (guide architecture)
  - Created memory/context/active.md
  - Created full directory structure

## After Compaction 1
- Tailscale in Docker was breaking ALL networking (DNS resolver had no upstream)
- This caused ALL API fallbacks to fail simultaneously — that's why Clint had to keep adding money
- Switched primary model from Opus → Sonnet (5x cheaper for daily use)
- Removed Tailscale from container, using Unraid host Tailscale plugin instead
- Tailscale working via host: plextopia=100.123.234.55, casper-1=100.70.201.31, mac=100.65.123.28
- casper-1 (Windows VM): SSH port 22 open ✅
- Mac: SSH closed — needs Remote Login enabled in System Settings → Sharing
- Fixed gateway pairing: token="koda-local-gateway", gatewayUrl="ws://127.0.0.1:18789"
- Cron now working! Weekly update check scheduled (Sundays 4:05 AM)
- Next: nightly backup to git (github.com/loperator692/koda-workspace), then agent templates
