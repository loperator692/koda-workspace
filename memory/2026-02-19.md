## Morning Briefing Cron Created
- Fixed gateway token issue (was using wrong token: koda-local-gateway vs db45299fa7920129e8016d808429ba0ce0b45142f49ad8e4)
- Created daily 7:30 AM morning briefing cron job (ID: 1752540c-b790-47f7-88c7-a2e2858ebb1d)
- Delivers via TTS voice to Telegram
- Content: Important emails, Salt Lake City weather, latest 2 Armstrong Economics posts
- Test run completed successfully (weather + Armstrong posts worked)

## Issues Found
- **Himalaya not installed** — email checking won't work until installed
- Primary model is Gemini Flash (free tier) instead of Sonnet → causing rate limits
- Need to fix model config back to Sonnet primary

## Next Steps
- Install Himalaya for email checking
- Fix primary model back to Sonnet (currently Flash)
- Tomorrow's 7:30 AM briefing will run automatically
